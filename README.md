# Particle-Electron-MQTT-WatsonIoT
How to use MQTT to connect a Particle Electron to the IBM Watson IoT Platform

## Introduction

## Learning Objectives:
In this workshop, you will learn how to:

### Part 1

- Learn about the Particle Electron
- Install the **particle** CLI
- Compile and flash

### Part 2
- Create an IoT Starter Kit application running in IBM Cloud
- Launch the Watson IoT Starter application
- Open the Watson IoT Platform so that you can send/receive MQTT data from the Particle device
- Create a Particle Electron device type and device
- Configure the Node-RED visual programming editor
- Secure your Node-RED Editor in IBM Cloud
- Install additional Node-RED nodes
- Import a prebuilt flow from GitHub
- Create a new Node-RED flow and configure IoT Nodes

### Part 3
- Learn about MQTT
- How to send MQTT data to Watson IoT

### Part 4
- MQTT Example #1 - MQTT to Watson IoT Quickstart (Insecure)
- MQTT Example #2 - MQTT to Watson IoT Registered Device (Insecure)
- MQTT Example #3 - Secure MQTT to Watson IoT
- MQTT Example #4 - Send SHT-31 data to Watson IoT
- MQTT Example #5 - Send DHT-11 / DHT-22 data to Watson IoT
- MQTT Example #6 - Send Particle Asset Tracker data to Watson IoT


# MQTT Examples

### 1 - MQTT to Watson IoT Quickstart

In this [example](examples/mqtt-quickstart/README.md), we demonstrate how to connect a Particle Electron to Watson IoT Quickstart using the MQTT library

### 2 - MQTT to Watson IoT Registered Device

In this  [example](examples/mqtt-wiotp/README.md), we demonstrate how to connect a Particle Electron to Watson IoT Platform using the MQTT library

### 3 - Secure MQTT to Watson IoT

In this  [example](examples/mqtt-tls-wiotp/README.md), we demonstrate how to connect a Particle Electron to Watson IoT Platform using the MQTT-TLS library

### 4 - Send SHT-31 data to Watson IoT

In this  [example](examples/mqtt-tls-wiotp-SHT/README.md), we demonstrate how to connect a Particle Electron and a SHT-31 temperature / humidity sensor to Watson IoT Platform using the MQTT-TLS library

### 5 - Send DHT-11 / DHT-22 data to Watson IoT

In this  [example](examples/mqtt-tls-wiotp-DHT/README.md), we demonstrate how to connect a Particle Electron and a DHT temperature / humidity sensor to Watson IoT Platform using the MQTT-TLS library

### 6 - Send Particle Asset Tracker data to Watson IoT

In this  [example](examples/mqtt-tls-wiotp-AssetTracker/README.md), we demonstrate how to connect a Particle Electron Asset Tracker accelerometer sensor to Watson IoT Platform using the MQTT-TLS library
